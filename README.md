# Tas1r2 Mouse Transcriptomics

This project explores the role of the *Tas1r2* sweet taste receptor in metabolically active tissues using transcriptomic data from BXD mice via GeneNetwork.org.

## Overview
- Conducted differential gene expression and correlation analysis across brown adipose tissue, heart, and liver
- Performed overrepresentation analysis (ORA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
- Generated figures and a mini-thesis-style report as part of MPH capstone

## Skills & Tools
- R (limma, rstatix, enrichR, tidyverse)
- ggplot2, volcano plots, heatmaps
- Statistical testing (t-tests, Pearson correlation)
- Reproducible research with RMarkdown

## Output
- Volcano plots, enrichment bar charts, and summary tables
- Written report + slide deck (ILE defense)
